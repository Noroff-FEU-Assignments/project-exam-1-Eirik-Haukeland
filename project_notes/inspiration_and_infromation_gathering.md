## what other say

as I talked to people that might be using this blog about what they need
it appears that most get to the sites that they use by googling a dish 
that they like to eat and then going to the bigger sites that turn up

the most trusted sites where [matprat](https://www.matprat.no/), 
[meny](https://meny.no/), [rema 100](https://www.rema.no/), and 
[den stolte hane](https://www.denstoltehane.no/) as these are not quite
blogs I search for popular food blogs and got the list detailed below

- add in the amount of people that the recipes was for and have the 
ingredients list update
- lots of god pictures (to se the steps)
- simple recipes
- says the time required in the recipe
