started on home page

made intial home page

used articles tag to indicate what the posts are *must
check if it is the rigth use-case for them*

desided to use articles in the charusell as I used them on
the remaing posts section (for consistensy)

I have run the markup thrue a [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options)
